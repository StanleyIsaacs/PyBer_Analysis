# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this report is to use PythonData and Jupyter Notebook to create a summary Data Frame illustrating ride share data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We used matplotlib and merged data sets and a variety of functions including, groupby, sum and line graphs, bubble charts, bar charts and pie charts. 

## Results
### Urban Fares Dominate:
Urban fares were by far the highest of the three types of cities with the most profitable time being mid-February to mid-March and the lowest period being at the begnning of the year. Suburban fares came in second with the most profitability being mid-February (like Urban) but also towards the end of April as well. Lowest period was again, the beginning of the year. Rural areas had the lowest fares generated by far with the most porfitability being the end of March- beginning of April which was still about a fifth of the peak period for Urban areas and only a third of the peak for Suburban areas. Again, the beginning of the year was the least profitable. See charts below for Pyber info.
