# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this report is to use PythonData and Jupyter Notebook to create a summary Data Frame illustrating ride share data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We used matplotlib and merged data sets and a variety of functions including, groupby, pivot, sum, line graphs, bubble charts, bar charts and pie charts. 

## Results
### Urban Fares Dominate:
Urban fares were by far the highest of the three types of cities with the most profitable time being mid-February to mid-March and the lowest period being at the begnning of the year. Suburban fares came in second with the most profitability being mid-February (like Urban) but also towards the end of April as well. Lowest period was again, the beginning of the year. Rural areas had the lowest fares generated by far with the most porfitability being the end of March- beginning of April which was still about a fifth of the peak period for Urban areas and only a third of the peak for Suburban areas. Again, the beginning of the year was the least profitable. See charts below for Pyber info.

## Summary
### Suggestions

First off, I'd recommend the company hire more drivers in rural areas. There are so few drivers who work out in the rural areas that I'm sure if we bump up the total count, money would rise. Obviously overall rural areas can't compete with Urban or Suburban but I am sure we can do better. It's worth noting that all the areas saw the most action in the same period of mid-April to mid-March. I suggest we do another study to find out why that is and why there is very little demand at the beginning of the year. But the main suggestion I have might be to run promos in rural areas to lower the average fares. Rural areas have the highest average fares so cost may be a prohibiting factor.
